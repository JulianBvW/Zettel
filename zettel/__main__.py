'''Entry point.

Run it from the repository:

    /usr/bin/python3 -m zettel --daemon

Note the interpreter. A plain `python3` may well be a conda or miniforge
build, and those do not ship the `gi` bindings -- the failure looks like
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gi'` and has nothing to do with Zettel.
